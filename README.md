## Usage 
For you to maneuver through this application with anyproblems the user will type in the city they wish to search on the weather tab. The user will be presented with a layout of the weather forcast up to the next 6 hours as well as the predicted forcast for the next 5 days, detailing the temperature in both fahrenheit and celsius, humidity, and precipitation. When the user tabs over to one of the other four tabs, night life, clothing stores, attractions, or restaurants they will be able to have their previous search on these pages pull up in the new tabs.

üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them there.

## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
